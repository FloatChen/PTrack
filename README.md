# PTrack

Off-Line Lagrangian Particle Tracking

# About

The particle tracking model this program implements (*PTrack*) was originally developed as a module embedded in the Unstructured Grid Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (*FVCOM*), first developed by Dr. Changsheng Chen et al. at the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth. The current iteration of the particle tracking code found here is an almost complete rewrite of this module, designed to run independently of *FVCOM*. Presently *FVCOM* is being developed and maintained by the UMASSD Marine Ecosystem Dynamics Modelling Laboratory (MEDML), and more information may be found on their website: http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/

# Running the model

PTrack requires the creation of three different configuration and data files.

* Model configuration file (text)
* Particle seed file (NetCDF)
* Tidal forcing and model domain file (NetCDF)

The tidal forcing file contains the flow-field data to drives the movement of the particles being simulated, as well as the data needed to reconstruct the physical domain (mesh, bathymetry, etc.), and is produced as the primary output of *FVCOM*. The structure and content of the text files will be elaborated on in the following sections. After compiling the input, the model may be run from the command-line using the start-up script:

```sh
start_tracking.sh run.dat
```

Where *run.dat* is the model configuration file.

## Configuration file

## Grid and Flow-field file

The NetCDF flow-field used to drive the particle tracking simulation is produced by *FVCOM*. While the grid portion of the flow-field may contain either Cartesian or Spherical coordinates, the particle tracking program requires Cartesian coordinates. If only Spherical coordinates are present the *fixproj* program may be used to apply a cartographic projection to the coordinates, in order to generate the necessary Cartesian coordinates. *fixproj* is automatically run by the start_tracking.sh script.

Normally this file will be automatically generated by *FVCOM*, and the user will not need to worry about its structure. The variables used by the particle tracking program are listed in the following table.

 Variable | Type  | Dimensions         | Units  | Description
 -------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------ | -----------
 time     | float | time               | MJD    | Days since 1858-11-17 00:00:00
 zeta     | float | time, node         | meters | Water surface elevation (upward positive)
 u        | float | time, siglay, nele | m/s    | Eastward water velocity
 v        | float | time, siglay, nele | m/s    | Northward water velocity
 ww       | float | time, siglay, nele | m/s    | Upward water velocity
 x        | float | node               | meters | Node x coordinate

 ntve     | int   | node               | none   | Number of elements surrounding each node
 nbve     | int   | maxelem, node      | none   | Elements surrounding each node
 siglev   | float | siglev, node       | none   | Sigma levels (boundary between layers)

 aw0      | float | three, nele        | none   | Shape coefficient array and control volume metrics
 awx      | float | three, nele        | none   | Shape coefficient array and control volume metrics
 awy      | float | three, nele        | none   | Shape coefficient array and control volume metrics

To ensure all of the required variables are present in the file, the following options should be enabled in the *casename_run.nml* configuration file for the *FVCOM* run.

* Configuration section: `NML_NETCDF`
* `NC_GRID_METRICS = T`
* `NC_VELOCITY = T`
* `NC_VERTICAL_VEL = T`

### *fixproj*

*fixproj* is designed to take spherical coordinates from a NetCDF file (**lon**,**lat**), transform the coordinates with a PROJ.4 cartographic projection reference, and save the results (**x**,**y**). By default *fixproj* will attempt to read the projection reference from the NetCDF file's global **CoordinateProjection** attribute, but if a reference is not found a new one will be generated to optimally fit the bounds of the data.

#### Command options

* `-p` *proj*
  * Provide a geographic projection reference string to be used.
* `-i`
  * Perform an inverse projection.
* `-v` *longitude_var latitude_var x_var y_var*
  * Provide alternative names for the coordinate variables.
* `-g`
  * Force the generation of a new projection reference.
* `-s`
  * Suppresses the write-back of the used projection reference.

#### Usage

```sh
fixproj [-p projection] [-i] [-v lon lat x y] [-g] [-s] file_to_process.nc
```

## Particle seed file

The particle seed file contains the initial positions of all particles to be released in the simulation, in addition to the release timing. This file is stored in NetCDF format, and the variables used are listed in the following table.

 Variable | Type  | Dimensions | Units  | Description
 -------- | ----- | ---------- | ------ | -----------
 number   | int   | number     | none   | Arbitrary identifier
 x        | float | number     | meters | Domain x coordinate
 y        | float | number     | meters | Domain y coordinate
 z        | float | number     | meters | Downward positive particle depth
 release  | float | number     | MJD    | Time to release particle into the simulation
 end      | float | number     | MJD    | Time to remove particle from the simulation

### *genseed*

*genseed* generates a NetCDF particle seed file from a text-based .dat file, allowing for some flexibility with the format of the input data. If a projection reference is not provided, it is assumed that the particle coordinates are already Cartesian. Note: the projection reference used for the seed file **must** match the reference used for the NetCDF flow-field file, otherwise the simulation results will be meaningless.

#### Command options

* `-p` *proj*
  * Use the provided geographic projection reference string (PROJ.4) to transform the seed file coordinates.
* `-o` *outfile*
  * Specify an output file. The name of the input file, except with a ".nc" extension, will be used if a name is not provided.
* `-t`
  * Dates in the input file will be formatted as `dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss`
* `-f` *projfile*
  * Same as -p, but read the projection reference from the provided NetCDF file's global CoordinateProjection attribute.

#### Usage

```sh
genseed [-o outfile.nc] [-t] [-p proj] [-f projfile.nc] particle_release.dat
```

#### File format

Each line of the file defines a different hypothetical seed particle, with the parameters separated by one or more spaces. The order of the parameters, along with their meaning, is given in the following table:

 Column | Name           | Type  | Units                        | Description
 ------ | -------------- | ----- | ---------------------------- | -----------
 1      | ID             | int   | none                         | Arbitrary identifier
 2      | X              | float | meters *or* degrees_east     | Domain x coordinate
 3      | Y              | float | meters *or* degrees_north    | Domain y coordinate
 4      | Z              | float | meters                       | Downward positive particle depth
 5      | Release Time   | float | MJD *or* yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss | Time to release particle into the simulation
 6      | Track End Time | float | MJD *or* yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss | Time to remove particle from the simulation

## Simulation output

The simulation output file contains all of the results from the simulation, and is also a NetCDF file. The variables this file contains are listed in the following table.

 Variable | Type  | Dimensions   | Units  | Description
 -------- | ----- | ------------ | ------ | -----------
 time     | float | time         | MJD    | Time the particle position was recorded
